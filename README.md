## Backstory

Imagine this: a sprawling media server packed to the brim with gigabytes (or even terabytes) of digital treasures. You've spent countless hours curating your collection, ensuring that every file is properly named and organized. But the more you collect, the harder it becomes to keep things tidy. That's where the File Foundry CLI comes in.

The journey to creating this tool began with a familiar tale. Frustration mounted as Colten grappled with a hodgepodge of messy files and buggy bash scripts. It was clear that a more powerful, flexible, and user-friendly solution was needed. So, the File Foundry CLI was born!

## What's in a Name?

- **File**: Because, well, it's all about files!
- **Foundry**: A place of creation and transformation. Your files will be reshaped and molded as you see fit.
- **CLI**: The Command-Line Interface that empowers you to take control of your media server files like a pro.
